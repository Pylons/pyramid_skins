Usage
-----

You can use the package in a variety of ways. It's designed to be
immediately useful without getting in the way or giving up
flexibility. In any case, the objective is to take the separation of
logic from presentation to the next step and also separate the
*wiring* from the codebase.

This is done by using symbolic (but predictable) object names instead
of file system paths::

  ./package/skins/images/logo.png    =>  "images/logo.png"
  ./package/skins/main_template.pt   =>  "main_template"

           â†³ mount point

The mount point constitutes a *skin directory*. You can register as
many skin directories as you need. The objects found are entered in a
global namespace, which means objects can be overriden. The last
registration *wins*.

Note that for the template ``main_template.pt``, the file extension is
left out from the object name. This is a behavior of the *template
factory* -- the default for the ``.pt`` extension.
