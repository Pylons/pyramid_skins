0.2 (2008-10-03)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Templates located in subdirectories are now named by replacing the
  operating system path separator with a forward slash symbol (often
  this will be the same character); before a dot '.' was
  used. [malthe]

- Added Template API base class. [malthe]

- Renamed ``IApi`` to ``ITemplateAPI``. [malthe]

- Template API components should adapt (context, request, template),
  where ``template`` is the skin template object (such an API might
  need to provide access to the template file itself, in order to get
  a path to resources local to the template). [malthe]

- Added ``render`` method to skin template class to allow rendering to
  a string instead of to a WebOb response. [malthe]

- Renamed package to ``repoze.bfg.skins`` [seletz]

- Added logic to allow registering and acquiring template API
  components from templates. [malthe]

- Changed the Skin Template View to be a class, and added a minimal
  interface ISkinTemplate to access the template path [seletz]

- Fixed a bug where we did not tear down the tests correctly [seletz]

- Fixed bug where the INewRequest event handler would call
  templates when checking for their existence [seletz]
