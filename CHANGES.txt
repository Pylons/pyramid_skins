Changelog
=========

0.10 (2009-01-28)

  - Added parameter ``content_type`` which will set the content type
    of the view response. [malthe]

  - Added ``macros`` attribute to the template object. [malthe]

0.9 (2008-12-05)

  - Updated signatures for skin template factory lookup
    functions. [malthe]

  - Added support for skin api methods. [malthe]

0.8 (2008-12-05)

  - Provide ``ISkinMacro`` unless ``provides`` is set; however, always
    provide ``ISkinTemplate``. Meanwhile, the macro accessor looks
    only for skin templates registered for the ``ISkinMacro``
    interface. [malthe]

0.7 (2008-12-04)

  - If ``provides`` is set, do not automatically provide the
    ``ISkinTemplate`` interface as well; this behavior made it
    difficult to program cascading rendering schemes. [malthe]

  - Keyword-arguments are now accepted by the utility methods for
    rendering skin templates using Python. [malthe]

  - Added security assertions to macro rendering function to prevent
    infinite loop if a template tries to render itself. [malthe]

0.6 (2008-12-03)

  - Do not register macro components separately, but make them
    available from the ``macro`` attribute of a skin
    template. [malthe]

0.5 (2008-12-03)

  - Added component lookup scheme for the bound skin template object
    which makes skin API components available using ``get_<name>``
    where <name> is the component name. [malthe]

  - Restructured package and changed look up scheme for skin APIs and
    macros. A symbol ``template`` is now available to skin templates;
    from this object, methods ``get_api`` and ``get_macro`` can be
    used to look up skin APIs and macros, respectively. [malthe]

  - Added render_skin_template_to_response and render_skin_template
    methods for general template rendering. [fairwinds]

0.4 (2008-11-13)

  - Added ``name`` attribute to skin template interface. [malthe]

  - No longer provide ``repoze.bfg.interfaces.IView`` by default; the
    ``provides`` attribute may now be used to specify an additional
    interface which the skin templates will provide. [malthe]

0.3 (2008-10-29)

  - Fix performance issue where template objects would be instantiated
    at every call. [malthe]

  - Pass keyword arguments to skin template callable. [malthe]

  - Instantiate page template directly. [malthe]

0.2 (2008-10-03)

  - Templates located in subdirectories are now named by replacing the
    operating system path separator with a forward slash symbol (often
    this will be the same character); before a dot '.' was
    used. [malthe]

  - Added Template API base class. [malthe]

  - Renamed ``IApi`` to ``ITemplateAPI``. [malthe]

  - Template API components should adapt (context, request, template),
    where ``template`` is the skin template object (such an API might
    need to provide access to the template file itself, in order to
    get a path to resources local to the template). [malthe]

  - Added ``render`` method to skin template class to allow rendering
    to a string instead of to a WebOb response. [malthe]

  - Renamed package to ``repoze.bfg.skins`` [seletz]

  - Added logic to allow registering and acquiring template API
    components from templates. [malthe]

  - Changed the Skin Template View to be a class, and added a minimal
    interface ISkinTemplate to access the template path [seletz]

  - Fixed a bug where we did not tear down the tests correctly
    [seletz]

  - Fixed bug where the INewRequest event handler would call templates
    when checking for their existence [seletz]

0.1 (2008-09-25)

  - Initial release [malthe]

  - Added support to dynamically register templates if they are added
    to a registered template directory [seletz]
