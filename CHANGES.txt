  [fschulze]


2.0 (2017-01-30)
----------------

- Fix compatibility with Pyramid 1.6 and newer. If you relied on using the
  descriptor feature of SkinObject, you now have to use BindableSkinObject
  instead.
  [fschulze]

- Support Python 3.
  [fschulze]


1.2 (2014-09-23)
----------------

- We are compatible with Pyramid 1.3 and up.
  [fschulze]

- Make pyramid_zcml optional.
  [fschulze]

- Fix skin reloading.
  [fschulze]


1.1 (2013-05-15)
----------------

- Fixed Pyramid 1.4 compatibility.
  [malthe]

- Chameleon's ``ProxyExpr`` is now a TALES-expression, and supports
  the pipe operator. We'll use it if it's available.

1.0 (2012-01-04)
----------------

- Fixed issue where an incorrect component registry was used to look
  up skin components.

- Fix Pyramid 1.2/1.3 compatibility.
  [amleczko]

- Ported to Pyramid framework.

0.22 (2011-04-07)
-----------------

- Fix skin reloading for request-specific skins.

0.21 (2011-04-01)
-----------------

- Allow request-specific skin registration (using the ``request_type``
  parameter to the skins directive). The request is retrieved from the
  thread-local manager at lookup-time.

- Add imperative configuration utility method.

0.20 (2009-12-14)
-----------------

- Compatibility fixes for BFG 1.2.

0.19 (2009-11-27)
-----------------

- Use the ``MacFSEvents`` module instead of ``pyfsevents``.

0.18 (2009-11-26)
-----------------

- Added discovery support (Mac OS X and Linux).

- Allow hyphens in the skin expression translator.

- Do not set charset on binary responses.

- Add content length to static responses.

0.17 (2009-11-16)
-----------------

- Skin objects used as descriptors now pass on the class instance
  dict as the keyword argument dictionary.

- Skin templates may now be used as macros.

- Make sure expression syntax is correct.

0.16 (2009-11-14)
-----------------

- Acquisition-like skin object lookup from within templates,
  e.g. ``skin: main_template`` will try to acquire the object from
  the current skin object path (if applicable), while ``skin:
  /main_template`` will always use an absolute (direct) lookup.

0.15 (2009-11-12)
-----------------

- Make ``name`` attribute public.

- Normalize path (ZCML does this, but we might be used
  imperatively).

- Raise runtime-error if view is attempted registered for unknown
  skin object (should never happen, but did because of an internal
  bug).

0.14 (2009-11-09)
-----------------

- Look up skin object on call if object has not been resolved.

- Added index view registration option.

- Use ``Chameleon`` egg.

- Pin package versions for testing.

0.13 (2009-10-30)
-----------------

- Rewrite. Backwards-compatibility broken.

  Migration path:

  Skins registration directive renamed to <bfg:skins>.

  To register views for skin objects, the <bfg:view> directive
  should be used inside a <bfg:skins> declaration. See
  documentation.

  Previous users should consult documentation for more information.

- Made compatible with repoze.bfg 1.1a4.

- Disuse ``component.adapts`` (unuseable in any BFG app), to make
  compatible with repoze.bfg 1.1a6+.

0.12 (2009-02-12)
-----------------

- Added convenience method ``get_skin_template_view``. [malthe]

- The ``get_skin_template`` method now accepts an optional
  ``request_type`` parameter, which takes priority in
  adaptation. [malthe]

- The ``provides`` parameter has been retired; instead, a ``class``
  parameter may be provided. By default this is set to the
  ``SkinTemplate`` class; to register a view, simply set it to
  ``SkinTemplateView`` (full module path required). [malthe]

0.11 (2009-02-09)
-----------------

- View permission is now only registered if a view must be
  provided. [malthe]

- Multiple interfaces may be specified as ``provides``. [malthe]

0.10 (2009-01-28)
-----------------

- Added parameter ``content_type`` which will set the content type
  of the view response. [malthe]

- Added ``macros`` attribute to the template object. [malthe]

0.9 (2008-12-05)
----------------

- Updated signatures for skin template factory lookup
  functions. [malthe]

- Added support for skin api methods. [malthe]

0.8 (2008-12-05)
----------------

- Provide ``ISkinMacro`` unless ``provides`` is set; however, always
  provide ``ISkinTemplate``. Meanwhile, the macro accessor looks
  only for skin templates registered for the ``ISkinMacro``
  interface. [malthe]

0.7 (2008-12-04)
----------------

- If ``provides`` is set, do not automatically provide the
  ``ISkinTemplate`` interface as well; this behavior made it
  difficult to program cascading rendering schemes. [malthe]

- Keyword-arguments are now accepted by the utility methods for
  rendering skin templates using Python. [malthe]

- Added security assertions to macro rendering function to prevent
  infinite loop if a template tries to render itself. [malthe]

0.6 (2008-12-03)
----------------

- Do not register macro components separately, but make them
  available from the ``macro`` attribute of a skin
  template. [malthe]

0.5 (2008-12-03)
----------------

- Added component lookup scheme for the bound skin template object
  which makes skin API components available using ``get_<name>``
  where <name> is the component name. [malthe]

- Restructured package and changed look up scheme for skin APIs and
  macros. A symbol ``template`` is now available to skin templates;
  from this object, methods ``get_api`` and ``get_macro`` can be
  used to look up skin APIs and macros, respectively. [malthe]

- Added render_skin_template_to_response and render_skin_template
  methods for general template rendering. [fairwinds]

0.4 (2008-11-13)
----------------

- Added ``name`` attribute to skin template interface. [malthe]

- No longer provide ``repoze.bfg.interfaces.IView`` by default; the
  ``provides`` attribute may now be used to specify an additional
  interface which the skin templates will provide. [malthe]

0.3 (2008-10-29)
----------------

- Fix performance issue where template objects would be instantiated
  at every call. [malthe]

- Pass keyword arguments to skin template callable. [malthe]

- Instantiate page template directly. [malthe]

0.2 (2008-10-03)
----------------

- Templates located in subdirectories are now named by replacing the
  operating system path separator with a forward slash symbol (often
  this will be the same character); before a dot '.' was
  used. [malthe]

- Added Template API base class. [malthe]

- Renamed ``IApi`` to ``ITemplateAPI``. [malthe]

- Template API components should adapt (context, request, template),
  where ``template`` is the skin template object (such an API might
  need to provide access to the template file itself, in order to
  get a path to resources local to the template). [malthe]

- Added ``render`` method to skin template class to allow rendering
  to a string instead of to a WebOb response. [malthe]

- Renamed package to ``repoze.bfg.skins`` [seletz]

- Added logic to allow registering and acquiring template API
  components from templates. [malthe]

- Changed the Skin Template View to be a class, and added a minimal
  interface ISkinTemplate to access the template path [seletz]

- Fixed a bug where we did not tear down the tests correctly
  [seletz]

- Fixed bug where the INewRequest event handler would call templates
  when checking for their existence [seletz]

0.1 (2008-09-25)
----------------

- Initial release [malthe]

- Added support to dynamically register templates if they are added
  to a registered template directory [seletz]
